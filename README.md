# WST-Portfolio


## Introduction

This was my second homework assignment. I was instructed to build my own portfolio. This is the first time I've ever gotten into the weeds of HTML and CSS. Many hours were put into this page, to include a Friday all-nighter. The one of the most unique requirements for this website was viewing compatibility with various devices. I get to that in a minute. Overall, this project kicked my butt. I can't imagine what week 4 will bring.

## Flex

Flex was all over this website. According to MDN, "The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container." So many sections have to respond to simultaneously to fit in such a small space. Header, main, section, and aside were the elements that used the display flex attribute.

## Links
  
Links were required for nav in the header, the first project container, and contact links near the footer. I added a some icons for the contact links. I included a phone, mailbox, and github. Also the links in the nav in the header transfer to the aside content titles.

## Project Containers

The first project needed to be the largest containter. I place this in its own class due to the size. All the other cards would be the same height and weight respectively. Initially I had ran into an issue with the quadrants not being the same size due to no height attribute for the card class. After getting some help from the TA, I made the adjustment and all four cards became the same height and width.

## Misc
  
Comments were added for clarity. I also added some spacing for legibility purposes.  

## Lessons Learned

I expect to make some changes in the future with this website. I plan to create aside sections as child elements to a section parent element. Or on the other hand, use grid boxes so that I may dictate where elements are located.
