            <p>Greetings world! My name is Wesley Taylor, but most call me "Wes". I was born and raised in the "Queen City", also known as, Charlotte, North Carolina. As a youth, I was extremely inquisitive of the world around me. Everyday was an adventure to explore new experiences. I was also an amateur artist. I had a passion to create visual and audio art.  Fast-forward to present day, I've traveled to over 20 countries! I'm also an inventor, entrepreneur, commercial drone pilot, and a music producer.</p>
            
            <p>So, how did I become a software developer? Better question -- why? Two years ago, I realized my full-time job at the time need a change. The hours were good, however, the pay was insufficient. My day-to-day operation didn't allow me to be creative; there was no spark, no passion. I desired change and I wasn't interested in a career of mediocrity. I was first introduce to coding through Udemy. It was a site that provided courses that covered almost every computer-based skill. I dabbled in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python 3. Instantly, my passion was rekindled. My purpose to create, was now more evident than ever. </p>
